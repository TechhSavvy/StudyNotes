# Classes

Now lets create a ```classes``` .ts file, and insert ```class``` called ```User```. 

Classes can have properties which is basically just a "key": "value" pair and then you have methods that which are just functions inside the class.

Lets give this class a property of ```name``` whitch has to be a ```string```, ``email`` whitch has to be a ```string```, and age whitch has to be a ```number```.

Those are the property of our User.

Now inside a class, you have something that is called a ```constructor``` this is a speical kind of method, that runs when you instantiate something with its class.

For example when you create a user this is going to run, and what we want to do is create a user and pass in its preperties to the ```constructor``` method is going to take the parameters of our ```User``` properties.


I know sounds kind difficult, we lets jst continue and you'll catch it right out of mid air.

So our construtor prarmeter will hold the same properties as our ```User``` class.

What we're going to do is assign these parameters to our user class.

Define ```this.name``` within the constructor block.

> When we use this. it pertains to its parent of name, such as the ```User``` class and set it to equal to ```name``` which is being passed in.

Same thing with ```email``` and ```age```, use ```this``` then set it equal to the parent in which we are referring to.

Lets also in this constructor block log a template literal string that says "User created" and assign this name.

```Ruby
constructor(name: string, email: string, age: number) { #// passing properties as parameters
        this.name = name;       #// this name is passed to is parent
        this.email = email;     #// this email is passed to is parent
        this.age = age;         #// this age is passed to is parent

        console.log(`User Created: ${this.name}`) #// logs object of user being created
    }
```

Now that's a class we just created, now what we'll want to do is create a user object.

So lets create a ```let``` variable named ```Savvy``` and we then equal savvy to a ```new``` ```User``` instants, which is the class we created, this instants takes a parameter of the constructors property as data, in which now we can assign store data and not the properties.

for example the new user method should store within its cury brackets lets say ```"Tech Savvy"``` we have now stored this as property ```this.name``` and this name is in a constructor which is then ran and instantiates its data to the class user.

We now have two more properties to fill in order to create our user object ```email``` and ```age```.

So lets also pass in an email address and a our age.

There we created a new user. 

```Ruby
let admin = new User("Tech Savvy", "tooensure@gmail.com", 22); #// object of user being created
```
