# TypeScript Functions

Lets create a new .ts file called functions. You may have to change you tsc to now compile the functions .ts file now.

So now stop the compiler and

```tsc functions.ts -w ```

Remeber ```tsc``` stands for TypeScript Compiler ```functions.ts``` is the folder that we're compiling and ```-w``` tell tsc to watch for changes in return it will automaically update.

You then going to want to include that into your html script.

But anyways
