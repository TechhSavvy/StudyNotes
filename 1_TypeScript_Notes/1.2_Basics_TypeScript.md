> Note: I'll be using terms a "key" of, that has or with a "value" of some kind. This is because i'm referring to the "key":"value" pairs when defining or transforming variblies, functions, etc. to *TypeScript Types*, which is the "value" of whatever you set its "key" to. for exapmle 

| *JavaScript Expression* |
| --- |
```Ruby 
var name;
name = "Tech Savvy";
console.log
```

| *TypeScrpt Expression* |

```Ruby 
var name: string;
name = "Tech Savvy";
console.log
```

# TypeScrips Basics

> Access your project .ts file

Lets start by defining a ```var``` of ```myString```. Done, now on a new line, lets set ```myString``` to ```"Hello World" ```. 
There, now we can console log myString.

```Ruby

var myString;

myString = "Hello World";

console.log(myString)

```
console output:

_```Hello World```_


Now this is vanilla JavaScript, although remember that all valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but lets be serious, were not using TypeScript just to still write JavaScript, lets put these abilities to use by turning our varible to a "key" varible as let ```myString``` have a "value" of *TypeScript Type* ```String```
