# TypeScrips Basics

> Access your project .ts file

Lets start by defining a ```var``` of ```myString```. Done, now on a new line, lets set ```myString``` to ```"Hello World" ```. 
There, now we can console log myString.

```Ruby

var myString;

myString = "Hello World";

console.log(myString)

```
console output:

_```Hello World```_

Now this is vanilla JavaScript, but remember that all valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but lets be serious, were not using TypeScript just to still write JavaScript to lets put these abilities to use by turning our varible to a "key" varible as let ```myString``` have a "value" of *TypeScript Type* ```String```
