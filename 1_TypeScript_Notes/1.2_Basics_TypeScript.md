# Some Quick Configuration

> Note: I'm using Angular framework, "TypeScript" is already configured with Angular/cli when creating a new project, So that's a Plus for Angular users. Although I'll stiil give the Non-Angular users the set up command lines so you can easly get started. From there every things pretty much a peace of cake.

### Confugure/Install

> Now before you can install TypeScript you must have npm and node install im going to assume you them installed already.

Open Terminal, here we're going to install TypeScript globally by

```npm install -g typescript```


Now locate into a folder where you'll like to create your files, create a directory then ```cd``` into that directory and create three files, a ```.ts```, ```.js```, and ```index.html``` names them as pleased, command line ```touch filename.ts``` allows you to do this.

I'll use this repository as example. 

> TypeScript_Studies/Playground

```
1._TypeScript_Studies
    |__Playground
        |__type.ts
        |__type.js
        |__index.html
```

Also don't forget to ```<script src="type.js"></script>``` in your index.html.

Since I'm using angular it's easy as in terminal locate into the directory you'll like to have your project then:

```ng new playground```

That's if you have Angular/cli installed, but anyways this will generate the project you'll be working in:

> playground/src/app

In this app directory you'll fine.

```
_app
    |__app.component.html
    |__app.component.ts
```


Angular users will need to run ```ng serve``` in terminal of project to open a server. Now we'll be able to write typescript code and automatically have it compiled to js. Don't worry much about not seeing a .js file.

On the other hand Non angular users will need to compile there .ts file into javascript by use of terminal in project directory and type ```tsc``` followed by the file they'll like to compile.


Don't worry i'll try my best so that I and you can get throw this and gain the up most knowledge
