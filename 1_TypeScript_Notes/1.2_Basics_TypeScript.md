> Note: I'll be using terms a "key" of, that has or with a "value" of some kind. This is because i'm referring to the "key":"value" pairs when defining or transforming variables, functions, etc. to *TypeScript Types*, which is the "value" of whatever you set its "key" to. for exapmle 

| *JavaScript Expression* |
| --- |
```Ruby 
var name;
name = "Tech Savvy";
console.log(name)       #// logs Tech Savvy
```

| *TypeScrpt Expression* |
| --- |
```Ruby 
let name: string;
name = "Tech Savvy";
console.log(name)       #// logs Tech Savvy
```
> As you can see our *TypeScrpt Expression* has a "key" variable of name and a "value" of string. Why? well thats exacly what we're going to learn in this section. Enjoy.

# TypeScript Basics

> Access your project .ts file

Lets start by defining a ```var``` of ```myString```. Done, now on a new line, lets set ```myString``` to ```"Hello World" ```. 
There, now we can console log myString.

```Ruby

let myString;

myString = "Hello World";

console.log(myString)       #// logs Hello World

```

Now, although we're using vanilla JavaScript, remember that all valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, so even this works in TypeScript.

Lets be serious, were not using TypeScript just to still write plain old vanilla JavaScript, lets put our TypeScript abilities to use by turning our JavaScript variable to a "key" variable of ```myString``` with "value" of ```String```.

```Ruby 
let myString: string;       #// let key: Value;
```

We have set the varible of myString to a string, at first, this allows more strict, debugable, clean code.

Lets assign ```myString``` equal to the value of ```1``` 

```Ruby 
let myString: string;       #// let key: Value;

myString = 1;       #// error Type '1' is not assignable to type 'string';         
```


This is not valid TypeScript Syntax, although if you're using tsc to compile this.

It'll still work.

*Necessarily* this is still valid JavaScript code. 

TypeScript emedutly notify you with error of this mistake, first in terminal in witch TypeScript is compiling, and secondly it'll place a red line under the code error, this will aviod future bugs and more readible code.
```ruby
error Type '1' is not assignable to type
```

Now if we replace the "key" myString, with a "value" of number rather then string. You'll see that it worked.

Why, because we've tode TypeScript that this "key" variable will hold a "value" of number, and although the "key" is named myString, it holds a "value" of a number.
```Ruby 
let myString: Number;       #// string is now number;

myString = 1;       #// myString is 1      
```

> Note: If not using VSC most likely you'll have to install a extention allowing this TypeScript error to show in editor other wise TypeScript will only show error in terminal.

Clear code editor, lets go over another example.

Here we create three variables.

* Define a ```let``` variable with a "key" of ```myString``` hold a "Value Type" of ```string```.

* Define a ```let``` variable with a "key" of ```myNumber``` hold a "Value Type" of ```number```.


* Define a ```let``` variable with a "key" of ```myboolean``` hold a "Value Type" of ```boolean```.

Ok, now that we defined the variables *Value Type*, lets assign these variables to a value.

* assign ```myString``` to equal ```"Hello World"```

* assign ```myNumber``` to equal ```22```

* assign ```myboolean``` to equal ```true```


Yes, i'm pretty sure you see where we're going with this.
Lets experiment just a little, but first log ```myboolean``` variable to the console.
```Ruby

let myString: string;       #// Variable type is string
let myNumber: number;       #// Variable type is number
let myBoolean: boolean;     #// Variable type is boolean

myString = "Hello World";   #// Variable has string value
myNumber = 22;              #// Variable has number value
myBoolean = true;           #// Variable has boolean value

console.log(myBoolean)      #// logs true which is a boolean type

```


Now what if I wrap ```myBoolean``` value of ```true``` with ```" "```(or single qoutes).

You'll get a error obviously,
```ruby
Type "true" is not assignable to type boolean
```

You just turned the value of ```true```, a boolean type to a string. If you wanted this variable to take a sting, go back and reassign the *Value Type* to string and not boolean, or even better assign the ```any``` *Value Type*, so that now we can use any *Value Type* as the value.

Lets set ```myBoolean``` value to, not just false, but a array that holds ```true```, ```false```, ```Tech Savvy```, 22;

Although in most cases we really wouldn't make a array like this, yet depends, I guess, all that matters right now is that it works perfectly fine. 

```Ruby

let myString: string;       #// Variable type is string
let myNumber: number;       #// Variable type is number
let myBoolean: any;     #// Variable type is boolean

myString = "Hello World";   #// Variable has string value
myNumber = 22;              #// Variable has number value
myBoolean = [
    true, 
    false, "
    Tech Savvy", 
    22
    ];                      #// Variable has any value


console.log(myBoolean)      #// logs true which is a boolean type

```

Although there is better way going about things.

Change ```myBoolean``` *Value Type* back to true.
