> Note: I'll be using terms a "key" of, that has or with a "value" of some kind. This is because i'm referring to the "key":"value" pairs when defining or transforming variables, functions, etc. to *TypeScript Types*, which is the "value" of whatever you set its "key" to. for exapmle 

| *JavaScript Expression* |
| --- |
```Ruby 
var name;
name = "Tech Savvy";
console.log(name)       #// logs Tech Savvy
```

| *TypeScrpt Expression* |
| --- |
```Ruby 
let name: string;
name = "Tech Savvy";
console.log(name)       #// logs Tech Savvy
```
> As you can see our *TypeScrpt Expression* has a "key" variable of name and a "value" of string. Why? well thats exacly what we're going to learn in this section. Enjoy.

# TypeScrips Basics

> Access your project .ts file

Lets start by defining a ```var``` of ```myString```. Done, now on a new line, lets set ```myString``` to ```"Hello World" ```. 
There, now we can console log myString.

```Ruby

let myString;

myString = "Hello World";

console.log(myString)       #// logs Hello World

```

Now, although we're using vanilla JavaScript, remember that all valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, so even this works in TypeScript.

Lets be serious, were not using TypeScript just to still write plain old vanilla JavaScript, lets put our TypeScript abilities to use by turning our JavaScript variable to a "key" variable of ```myString``` with "value" of ```String```.

```Ruby 
let name: string;
```
