# Getting Started with TypeScript

> Note: I'm using Angular framework, "TypeScript" is already configured with Angular/cli when creating a new project, So that's a Plus for Angular users. Although I'll stiil give the Non-Angular users the set up command lines so you can easly get started. From there every things pretty much a peace of cake.

### Confugure/Install

> Now before you can install TypeScript you must have npm and node install im going to assume you them installed already.

Open Terminal, here we're going to install TypeScript globally by

```npm install -g typescript```

Now locate into a folder where you'll like to create your files, create a directory then ```cd``` into that directory.
I'll use this repository as mines.
