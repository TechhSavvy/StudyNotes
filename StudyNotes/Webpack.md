# Webpack Quick introduction

Used to take modules with dependentcies and generate static assets from them,
That way we can now build things with modules, either custom or things we install from npm.

With that said we then can compile it down to code that can run in the browser.

Yea pretty amozon, also it what's run behind angular technology cli.
Its compiles everything from thoses framwork and there dependentcies down to static assets that can run in the browser.

It allow the frontend framwork to run without a backend server.

Webpack uses presets that can add extra functionality.

for example there a preset to compile reacts code, also babel to es2016, es2017 etc.
